## Tiny NeRF dataset

![image-20230608154935173](image-20230608154935173.png)

Originally Tiny NeRF dataset was provided by UC Berkely EECS before. However currently UC Berkely does NOT provide this dataset. I don't know the reason why. So instead of the UC Berkely's link, I will use the UC San Diego's link for a while.

```bash
wget https://cseweb.ucsd.edu//~viscomp/projects/LF/papers/ECCV20/nerf/tiny_nerf_data.npz
```
